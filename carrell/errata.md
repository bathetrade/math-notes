* Example 3.11: $x₁ = -x₂ - 2x₃ - 3x₅ + x₆$ and the following sentence
  talking about $x₂$ is incorrect.
* Exercise 4.2.12: should be:
    2. Show that if D(n) is the set of diagonal matrices in SP(n), then D(n) is a normal subgroup of SP(n). 
    3. Show SP(n)/D(n) is isomorphic to P(n). 
* Exercise 5.1.15: uses symbols O and * not defined anywhere.
* Exercise 6.4.14: "Let W and X ..."
* Exercise 6.4.21: in the denominator, $p^n$ should be $p^m$
* Exercise 6.4.23: part 2 is impossible. See ex6.4.23.py
  See https://mathworld.wolfram.com/LightsOutPuzzle.html
* Proposition 6.23: second sentence before the last should be: v = w + y = w' + y'
* Proposition 6.43 has several errors
    * (i) should be d(u, v) = 0 iff u = v
    * (iii) The proof swaps v and w
