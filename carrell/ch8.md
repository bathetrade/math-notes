# $σᵢ(A)$ Formula

First note that the determinant is multi-linear, so we can write
$$ A = \M{
    a₁₁ - x, ⋯  ;
    ⋯, aₙₙ - x
} = \M{
    a₁₁, ⋯  ;
    ⋯, aₙₙ
} - \M{
    x, ⋯    ;
    ⋯, aₙₙ
} - \M{
    x, ⋯    ;
    ⋯, aₙₙ
} + \M{
    x, ⋯    ;
    ⋯, x
} $$

Assume we have a single $aᵢᵢ = x$. We are only interested in the coefficient for $x$.
Fixing $π$ and using the Leibniz formula, we get
$$ k = -x ∑_{π ∈ S(n) : π(i)=i} \sgn(π) a_{1π(1)} ⋯ a_{(i-1)π(i-1)} a_{(i+1)π(i+1)} ⋯ a_{nπ(n)} $$
Using the same argument as for the Laplace expansion, when we have $P_π$, and delete the $i$th column and row,
then $P_π' = P_{π'}$ corresponds to a valid $π' ∈ S(n - 1)$. Then $\sgn(π) = \sgn(π')$, since the element
at $π(i) = i$ is already in the identity position.
$$ k = -x \det(Aᵢᵢ) $$
Using the multilinearity we see
$$ σ₁(A) = -x ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ \det(Aᵢᵢ) $$

We can generalize the argument above, by fixing $π(i₁) = i₁, …, π(iₘ) = iₘ$. Then we sum over the permutations
for the remaining minor matrices $A₍ₙ₋ₘ₎₍ₙ₋ₘ₎$. Note that in the multilinear expansion, the leading unit is $(-1)ᵐ$.

Thus we get the generalized formula for characteristic polynomial.

# Exercises 8.1

## Ex 8.1.10: Matrices with Same Charpoly are Similar

Let $B = \M{3, -2; 2, -1}$, then $\charpoly(B) = \charpoly(I)$ but they are not similar since $S = PIP⁻¹ = I$.

## Ex 8.1.12: $0$ is an Eigenvalue of $A ⟺ A$ is Singular

This means the constant term of charpoly is $0$. Therefore there is a row $i$ with $(A - xI)ᵢᵢ = -x$ and all other entries $0$.
Which means $A$ has a row of all zeroes, and hence is singular.
