	<p>
	  Let &pi;<sub>1</sub> and &pi;<sub>2</sub> be two even permutations.

	<p>
	  Without loss of generality, let &pi;<sub>1</sub> be odd and let

	  product of transpositions. Then, &pi;<sub>1</sub> has 2i+1
	  transpositions and &pi;<sub>2</sub> has 2j transpositions. Their
	  product has a total of 2i+1+2j = 2(i+j)+1 transpositions, and is

	</p>
	</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
	Prove each of the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
	<li>
	<p>
	  A cycle of length l is even if l is odd.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>
	  A cycle of length l is odd if l is even.
	</p>
	</li>
      </ol>
      <p><span class="Ind">Base</span>
	The cycle (&alpha;<sub>0</sub>&alpha;<sub>1</sub>) has length two,
	which is even, and it can be written as one transposition, which
	makes it odd.
      </p>
      <p><span class="Ind">Hypothesis</span>
	Assume that, for any cycle of length l, if l is even, the cycle is
	odd, while if l is odd, the cycle is even.
      </p>
      <p><span class="Ind">Step</span>
	Let &alpha; =
	(&alpha;<sub>0</sub>&alpha;<sub>1</sub>...&alpha;<sub>l</sub>) be
	a cycle of length l+1. Then, define &alpha;<sup>-</sup> =
	(&alpha;<sub>1</sub>...&alpha;<sub>l</sub>) is a cycle of length l.
	By the Induction Hypothesis, if l is even, &alpha;<sup>-</sup> is
	odd, and if l is odd, &alpha;<sup>-</sup> is even.
      </p>
      <p>
	&alpha; = (&alpha;<sub>1</sub>&alpha;<sub>0</sub>)&alpha;<sup>-</sup>.
	Since &alpha; has one more transposition than &alpha;<sup>-</sup>,
	if &alpha;<sup>-</sup> is odd, &alpha; is even, while if
	&alpha;<sup>-</sup> is even, &alpha; is odd. At the same time, if l
	is even, l+1 is odd, while if l is odd, l+1 is even.
      </p>
      <p>
	In anticipation of the next exercise, these can be re-stated as:
	"A cycle of length l is even or odd depending on whether l-1 is even
	or odd."
      </p>
    </li>

    <li id="Ex04">
      <p>
	Prove each of the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
	<li>
	<p>
	  If &alpha; and &beta; are cycles of length l and m, respectively,
	  then &alpha;&beta; is even or odd depending on whether (l+m-2) is
	  even or odd.
	</p>

	<p>
	  This may be re-written as "&alpha;&beta; is even or odd depending on
	  whether (l-1)+(m-1) is even or odd."
	</p>

	<p>
	  By the previous exercise, a cycle is even or odd when its length
	  less one is even or odd. By Exercise 2, the product of any two
	  permutations (whether or not they are cycles) is odd if and only if
	  exactly one of them is odd. By the laws of integer arithmetic, the
	  sum of two integers (such as (l-1) and (m-1)) is odd if and only if
	  exactly one of them is odd.
	</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p>
	  If &pi; = &beta;<sub>1</sub>...&beta;<sub>r</sub>, where each
	  &beta;<sub>i</sub> is a cycle of length l<sub>i</sub>, then &pi; is
	  even or odd depending on whether l<sub>1</sub> + ... + l<sub>r</sub>
	  - r is even or odd.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Re-write l<sub>1</sub> + ... + l<sub>r</sub> -r as (l<sub>1</sub>-1)
	  + ... (l<sub>r</sub>-1), and proceed by induction.
	</p>

	<p><span class="Ind">Base</span>
	   The case for r=2 was proved in Exercise 3.
	</p>

	<div class="SideBar">
	<p>
	  By "parity", I mean "whether it is even or odd".
	</p>
	</div>

	<p><span class="Ind">Hypothesis</span>
	   Assume that the product &beta;<sub>1</sub>...&beta;<sub>k</sub> has
	   the same parity as (l<sub>1</sub>-1) + ... + (l<sub>k</sub>-1).
	</p>

	<p><span class="Ind">Step</span>
	   By Exercise 2, the parity of
	   &beta;<sub>1</sub>...&beta;<sub>k</sub>&beta;<sub>k+1</sub> will
	   differ from that of &beta;<sub>1</sub>...&beta;<sub>k</sub> only
	   when &beta;<sub>k+1</sub> is odd. By the laws of integer arithmetic,
	   the parity of (l<sub>1</sub>-1) + ... + (l<sub>k</sub>-1) +
	   (l<sub>k+1</sub>-1) will differ from that of (l<sub>1</sub>-1) +
	   ... + (l<sub>k</sub>-1) only when (l<sub>k+1</sub>-1) is odd.
