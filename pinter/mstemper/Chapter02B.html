  <h1 id="Top">Problem B &mdash; Properties of Operations</h1>

<div class="Section Problem">
  <p>
    For each of the following operations (on <span class="Set">R</span>),
    determine whether it is commutative, associative, has an identity
    element, has an inverse.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>x*y = x + 2y + 4</p>
      <p>It is not commutative, since (x + 2y + 4) does not generally
	 equal (y + 2x + 4).</p>
      <p>(x*y)*z = (x + 2y + 4)*z = x + 2y + 4 + 2z + 4 = x + 2y + 2z + 8.<br>
	 x*(y*z) = x*(y + 2z + 4) = x + 2y + 4z + 8 + 4 = x + 2y + 4z +12.<br>
	 Since these are not generally equal, this is not associative.</p>
      <p>Solving e*y = y for e gives: e + 2y + 4 = y; e = -(y+4) as a
	 left identity. Since this is a function of y, this operation does
	 not have a identity.</p>
      <p>Since the operation does not have an identity, it is not meaningful
	 to ask if it has an inverse.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>x*y = x + 2y - xy</p>
      <p>It is not commutative, since (x + 2y - xy) does not generally
	 equal (y + 2x - yx).</p>
      <p>(x*y)*z = (x + 2y - xy)*z = (x + 2y - xy + 2z - z(x + 2y - xy)) =
	 (x + 2y - xy + 2z - xz - 2yz + xyz).<br>
	 x*(y*z) = x*(y + 2z - yz) = (x + 2(y + 2z - yz) - x(y + 2z - yz)) =
	 (x + 2y + 4z - 2yz - xy - 2xz + xyz).<br>
	 Since these are not generally equal, this is not associative.</p>
      <p>Solving e*y = y for e gives: e + 2y - ey = y; e = -y/(1-y).
	 Since this is a function of y, this operation does not
	 have a identity.</p>
      <p>Since the operation does not have an identity, it is not meaningful
	 to ask if it has an inverse.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>x*y = |x + y|</p>
      <p>Since x+y = y+x, |x + y| = |y + x|, so this is commutative.</p>
      <p>Let x=1, y=-2, and z=3.<br>
	 Then (x*y)*z = ||1 + -2| + 3| = ||-1| + 3| = |1 + 3| = 4.<br>
	 x*(y*z) = |1 + |-2 + 3|| = |1 + |1|| = |1 + 1| = 2.<br>
	 This operation is not associative.
      <p>Since the operation always returns a non-negative number, it
	 can not have an identity element.</p>
      <p>Since the operation does not have an identity, it is not meaningful
	 to ask if it has an inverse.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>x*y = |x - y|</p>
      <p>Since (x-y) = -(y-x), |x - y| = |y - x|, and this is commutative.</p>
      <p>Let x=1, y=2, and z=3.<br>
	 Then (x*y)*z = ||1 - 2| - 3| = ||-1| - 3| = |1 - 3| = 2.<br>
	 x*(y*z) = |1 - |2 - 3|| = |1 - |-1|| = |1 - 1| = 0.<br>
	 This operation is not associative.
      <p>Since the operation always returns a non-negative number, it
	 can not have an identity element.</p>
      <p>Since the operation does not have an identity, it is not meaningful
	 to ask if it has an inverse.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>x*y = xy + 1</p>
      <p>Since xy=yx, xy + 1 = yx + 1, and this is commutative.</p>
      <p>(x*y)*z = (xy + 1)*z = xyz + z + 1.<br>
	 x*(y*z) = x*(yz + 1) = xyz + x + 1.<br>
	 Since these are not generally equal, this is not associative.</p>
      <p>Solving e*y=y for e gives: ey + 1 = y; e = 1 - 1/y.
	 Since this is a function of y, this operation does not
	 have a identity.</p>
      <p>Since the operation does not have an identity, it is not meaningful
	 to ask if it has an inverse.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>x*y = <span class="Function">max</span>(x,y)</p>
      <p>Since the maximum of two numbers is not affected by their order,
	 this is a commutative operation.</p>
      <p>Since the maximum of three numbers is not affected by their order,
	 this is an associative operation.</p>
      <p>Let e be a proposed identity element for this operation. Let
	 y = e-1. Then, <span class="Function">max</span>(e,y) = e
	 rather than y, so e is not an identity element.</p>
      <p>Since the operation does not have an identity, it is not meaningful
	 to ask if it has an inverse.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>x*y = (xy)/(x+y+1), on <span class="Set">R<sup>+</sup></span></p>
      <p>Since xy=yx and (x+y+1)=(y+x+1), this is commutative.</p>
      <p>(x*y)*z = (xy/(x+y+1))*z = xyz/(xy+xz+yz+x+y+z+1)<br>
	 x*(y*z) = x*((yz)/(y+z+1)) = xyz/(xy+xz+yz+x+y+z+1)<br>
	 Surprisingly (to me), this operation is associative.</p>
      <p>Solving e*y=y for e gives ey/(e+y+1)=y &rarr; e/(e+y+1)=1 &rarr;
	 e=e+y+1 &rarr; y=-1. Since e drops out, this operation has no
	 identity element.</p>
      <p>Since the operation does not have an identity, it is not meaningful
	 to ask if it has an inverse.</p>
    </li>
