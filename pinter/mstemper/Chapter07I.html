  <h1 id="Top">Problem I &mdash; The Algebra of Kinship Structures</h1>

<div class="Section Problem" id="ProblemI">

  <p>
    Let <span class="Set">K</span> be the set of clans in a society, with
    k<sub>i</sub>&isin;<span class="Set">K</span> for i&isin;{1, ... n}. We
    have the following rules:
  </p>

  <ol class="KinshipRules">
    <li>The clans form an equivalence relation on the society.</li>
    <li>If a man is a member of k<sub>j</sub>, then he must marry a woman
	from clan w(k<sub>j</sub>), where
	w:<span class="Set">K</span>&rarr;<span class="Set">K</span>.</li>
    <li>If w(x)=w(y) then x=y.</li>
    <li>If a man is a member of k<sub>j</sub>, then his children are in
	clan c(k<sub>j</sub>), where
	c:<span class="Set">K</span>&rarr;<span class="Set">K</span>.</li>
    <li>If c(x)=c(y) then x=y.</li>
    <li>A man cannot marry a woman of his own clan: w(x)&ne;x.</li>
    <li>For any x,y there is a permutation &alpha; that is the composite
	of various of w, w<sup>-1</sup>, c, and c<sup>-1</sup> such that
	&alpha;(x)=y.</li>
    <li>If for any &alpha; and &beta; that are compostions of the various
	kinship relations &alpha;(k<sub>j</sub>) = &beta;(k<sub>j</sub>),
	then &alpha;(k<sub>i</sub>) = &beta;(k<sub>i</sub>) for all
	i&isin;{1, ... n}</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Letting <span class="Set">G</span> be the group of all compostions of
    the various kinship relations and their inverses, prove items 1-3, and
    explain items 4-9:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
	If &alpha;(k<sub>i</sub>)=k<sub>i</sub> for any clan k<sub>i</sub>,
	then &alpha;=e (the identity).
      </p>

      <p>
	e(k<sub>j</sub>)=k<sub>j</sub> for any clan k<sub>j</sub>.
	Since &alpha;(k<sub>i</sub>)=k<sub>i</sub>, Rule viii says that
	&alpha; = e.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
	&exist;m&le;n such that &alpha;<sup>m</sup> = e.
      </p>

      <p>
	Since |<span class="Set">K</span>|=n, &exist; p,q
	(1&le;p,q&le;n+1 and p&ne;q) such that
	&alpha;<sup>p</sup>(k<sub>i</sub>) =
	&alpha;<sup>q</sup>(k<sub>i</sub>), by the pigeon-hole principle.
	Without loss of generality, let p&gt;q.
	Rule viii implies that &alpha;<sup>p-q</sup>=e. Since p&le;n+1,
	p-q&le;n.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
	<span class="Set">G</span> consists of exactly n permutations.
      </p>

      <p>
	By rule vii, there must be at least n permutations, in order to map
	x to each different k<sub>i</sub>&isin;<span class="Set">K</span>.
	If there were more than n permutations, two of them would map x
	to the same k<sub>i</sub>. By rule viii, these two permutations
	would be identical. Therefore, there are exactly n permutations.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
	If a person belongs to clan k<sub>i</sub>, their father belongs
	to c<sup>-1</sup>(k<sub>i</sub>). If a woman belongs to clan
	k<sub>j</sub>, her husband belongs to w<sup>-1</sup>(k<sub>j</sub>).
      </p>

      <p>
	The identity function maps a clan to itself. Since all children of
	a father belong to the same clan, the clan of the children of the
	father of a person is that person's clan, which is modeled by
	c&#8728;c<sup>-1</sup> = e. Since the wives of all of the men in a
	given clan are from one (different) clan, the clan of the wives of
	the men in the clan of one woman's husband is that person's clan,
	which is modeled by w&#8728;w<sup>-1</sup> = e.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
	If a man is in the same clan as his son, c=e. If a woman is in the
	same clan as her son, c=w.
      </p>

      <p>
	If a man and his son are both in clan k<sub>j</sub>, then
	c(k<sub>j</sub>) = k<sub>j</sub>. By Exercise 1, c=e.
      </p>

      <p>
	If a man is in clan k<sub>j</sub>, then his wife is in
	clan w(k<sub>j</sub>) and his son (hence <em>her</em> son) is in
	clan c(k<sub>j</sub>). If w(k<sub>j</sub>) = c(k<sub>j</sub>),
	then w=c by rule viii.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
	If a person is in clan k<sub>i</sub>, the clan of their mother's
	sister's son is
	c&#8728;w<sup>-1</sup>&#8728;w&#8728;c<sup>-1</sup>(k<sub>i</sub>),
	which prohibits marriage between matrilineal parallel cousins.
      </p>

      <p>
	Call the person in question "x". Since x is in clan k<sub>i</sub>,
	the father of x is in clan c<sup>-1</sup>(k<sub>i</sub>), the
	mother of x is in clan w&#8728;c<sup>-1</sup>(k<sub>i</sub>),
	as is her sister. Then, the husband of x's mother's sister is in
	clan w<sup>-1</sup>&#8728;w&#8728;c<sup>-1</sup>(k<sub>i</sub>),
	and the son of x's mother's sister's husband (who is, of course,
	also the son of x's mother's sister) is in clan
	c&#8728;w<sup>-1</sup>&#8728;w&#8728;c<sup>-1</sup>(k<sub>i</sub>).
      </p>

      <table class="Derive">
	<tr>
	  <td>c&#8728;w<sup>-1</sup>&#8728;w&#8728;c<sup>-1</sup></td>
	  <td>c&#8728;e&#8728;c<sup>-1</sup></td>
	  <td>inverses</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td></td>
	  <td>c&#8728;c<sup>-1</sup></td>

	  <td>inverses</td>
	</tr>
      </table>

      <p>
	By rule ii, people from the same clan cannot marry.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
	Marriage between a man and the daughter of his father's sister
	is prohibited.
      </p>

      <p>
	Let the man be "y", and let him be a member of clan k<sub>j</sub>.
	The father of y is a member of c<sup>-1</sup>(k<sub>j</sub>), as
	is the sister of the father of y. The husband of the sister of the
	father of y comes from clan
	w<sup>-1</sup>&#8728;c<sup>-1</sup>(k<sub>j</sub>), and his daughter
	is a member of clan
	c&#8728;w<sup>-1</sup>&#8728;c<sup>-1</sup>(k<sub>j</sub>). If a
	man can marry the daughter of his father's sister, then
	w = c&#8728;w<sup>-1</sup>&#8728;c<sup>-1</sup>.
      </p>

      <p>
	The assertion is false. One counter-example will suffice to show this.
      </p>

      <p>
	If there are only two clans (n=2), then w = w<sup>-1</sup>. If we let
	c = e (explicitly allowed by exercise 5), then the above expression
	turns into:
      </p>

      <table class="Derive">

	  <td>w</td>

	  <td>above expression</td>

	  <td>&nbsp;</td>
	  <td>c&#8728;w&#8728;c<sup>-1</sup></td>
	  <td>w = w<sup>-1</sup></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>&nbsp;</td>
	  <td>e&#8728;w&#8728;e<sup>-1</sup></td>
	  <td>c = e</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>&nbsp;</td>
	  <td>e&#8728;w&#8728;e</td>
	  <td>identity is its own inverse</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>&nbsp;</td>
	  <td>w</td>
	  <td>identity</td>
	</tr>
      </table>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
	If matri-lineal cross-cousins may marry (that is, a woman may marry
	the son of her mother's brother), then c&#8728;w =
	w<sup>-1</sup>&#8728;c.
      </p>

      <p>
	If the woman is in clan k<sub>j</sub>, then her father is in clan 
	c<sup>-1</sup>(k<sub>j</sub>). Her mother, and her mother's brother,
	are in clan w&#8728;c<sup>-1</sup>(k<sub>j</sub>). Her mother's
	brother's son is in clan c&#8728;w&#8728;c<sup>-1</sup>(k<sub>j</sub>).
	If he can marry her, then she is in clan
	w&#8728;c&#8728;w&#8728;c<sup>-1</sup>(k<sub>j</sub>).
      </p>

      <table class="Derive">

    <li>
      <p>
	If patri-lineal cross-cousins may marry (that is, a woman may marry the
	son of her father's sister), then c and w<sup>-1</sup> commute.
      </p>

      <p>
	If the woman is in clan k<sub>j</sub>, then her father is in clan 
	c<sup>-1</sup>(k<sub>j</sub>), as is her father's sister. Her father's
	sister's husband is in clan
	w<sup>-1</sup>&#8728;c<sup>-1</sup>(k<sub>j</sub>), and his son is in
	clan c&#8728;w<sup>-1</sup>&#8728;c<sup>-1</sup>(k<sub>j</sub>). If
	she can marry him, then she is in clan
	w&#8728;c&#8728;w<sup>-1</sup>&#8728;c<sup>-1</sup>(k<sub>j</sub>).
