  <h1 id="Top">Problem F &mdash; Isomorphism of Groups Given by Generators
    and Defining Equations</h1>

<div class="Section Problem" id="ProblemF">

  <p>
    We are supposed to prove that each of the succeeding pairs of groups,
    <span class="Set">G</span> and <span class="Set">G'</span>, are
    isomorphic.
  </p>

  <p>
    In Chapter 5, Dr. Pinter brushed over the possibility of different groups
    (of different cardinalities) being generated by the same set of defining
    equations. For instance, in <a href="Chapter05F#Ex01">Problem F,
    Exercise 1</a>, we need to consider the possibility that there is another
    combination of elements besides {e, a, b, b<sup>2</sup>, ab, ab<sup>2</sup>}
    that satisfies the equations a<sup>2</sup>=e, b<sup>3</sup>=e,
    ba=ab<sup>2</sup>. Could there be a different, possibly larger, set that
    meets these criteria?
  </p>

  <p>
    This turns out not to be possible. Since <span class="Set">G</span> is a
    group that contains a and b, the closure property assures us that it also
    contains all possible products of any finite number of a's and b's. Any
    proposed additional element will turn out to be equivalent to one of the
    existing elements.
  </p>

  <p>
    For instance, we could attempt to augment <span class="Set">G</span> with
    the element b<sup>2</sup>a. However, this turns out to be equivalent to
    ab, as may be seen in the <a href="Chapter05F#Ex01">Cayley table</a> of
    <span class="Set">G</span>.
  </p>

  <p>
    We may view the explicitly-stated members of a group defined by generators
    and defining equations as representatives of equivalence classes of all
    possible equivalent products. Practically speaking, it is not necessary to
    even specify the members of the group &mdash; the generators and equations
    uniquely determine the group. (This is <em>implied</em> by the title of
    Problem F of Chapter 5.)
  </p>

  <p>
    With this issue resolved, I can now proceed to the exercises. All that is
    necessary to show isomorphism in each case is to show that the groups not
    specified by generating equations have elements that satisfy those
    equations. Preservation of all other products, as well as bijection,
    follow from that fact.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>

      <div class="SideBar">
      <p>
	<span class="Set">G'</span> is the
	<a href="Chapter05F#Ex02">dihedral group,
	<span class="Set">D<sub>4</sub></span></a>.
      </p>
      </div>

      <p>
	<span class="Set">G</span> is the subgroup of
	<span class="Set">S<sub>4</sub></span> generated by (24) and (1234);
	<span class="Set">G'</span> = {e, a, b, b<sup>2</sup>, b<sup>3</sup>,
	ab, ab<sup>2</sup>, ab<sup>3</sup>}, where a<sup>2</sup>=e,
	b<sup>4</sup>=e, ba=ab<sup>3</sup>.
      </p>

      <p>
	Since raising a cycle of length n to the nth power produces the
	identity, (24) &#x2258; a and (1234) &#x2258; b satisfy the first two
	equations.
      </p>

      <p>
	Substituting (24) for a and (1234) for b gives ba = (1234)(24) =
	(12)(34). Similar substitution gives ab<sup>3</sup> =
	(24)(1234)(1234)(1234) = (12)(34).
      </p>

      <p>
	Since the proposed mapping satisfies all of the defining equations,
	these two groups are isomorphic.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
	<span class="Set">G</span> = <span class="Set">S<sub>3</sub></span>;
	<span class="Set">G'</span> = {e, a, b, ab, aba, abab}, where
	a<sup>2</sup> = e, b<sup>2</sup> = e, and bab = aba.
      </p>

      <p>
	If we let (12) &#x2258; a and (23) &#x2258; b, a<sup>2</sup> = e and
	b<sup>2</sup> = e are immediately satisfied.
      </p>

      <p>
	Substituting (12) for a and (23) for b gives aba = (12)(23)(12) =
	(13), and also gives bab = (23)(12)(23) = (13). Therefore, the third
	defining equation is also satisfied.
      </p>

      <p>
	Since the proposed mapping satisfies all of the defining equations,
	these two groups are isomorphic.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <div class="SideBar">
      <p>
	To reduce ambiguity, I will use "A" and "B" to refer to the generators
	of <span class="Set">D<sub>4</sub></span> in this exercise.
      </p>
      </div>

      <p>
	<span class="Set">G</span> =
	<a href="Chapter05F#Ex02"><span class="Set">D<sub>4</sub></span></a>;
	<span class="Set">G'</span> = {e, a, b, ab, aba, (ab)<sup>2</sup>, ba,
	bab} where a<sup>2</sup> = b<sup>2</sup> = e, and (ab)<sup>4</sup> = e.
      </p>

      <p>
	Mapping B &#x2258; (ab) satisfies the last equation. Finding two other
	elements in <span class="Set">D<sub>4</sub></span> that are
	self-inverses and whose product is B will satisfy the first two
	equations. Inspection of the Cayley table of
	<span class="Set">D<sub>4</sub></span> shows that
	A &#x2258; a and AB &#x2258; b meet the requirements.
      </p>

      <p>
	The final mapping is:
      </p>

      <table>
	<tr>
	  <th><span class="Set">G</span>
	      (<span class="Set">D<sub>4</sub></span>)</th>
	  <td>A</td>
	  <td>B</td>
	  <td>AB</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <th><span class="Set">G'</span></th>
	  <td>a</td>
	  <td>ab</td>
	  <td>b</td>
	</tr>
      </table>

      <p>
	Since the proposed mapping satisfies all of the defining equations,
	these two groups are isomorphic.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li id="Ex04">
      <p>
	<span class="Set">G</span> =
	  <span class="Set">Z<sub>2</sub></span> &times;
	  <span class="Set">Z<sub>2</sub></span> &times;
	  <span class="Set">Z<sub>2</sub></span>;
	<span class="Set">G'</span> = {e, a, b, c, ab, bc, ac, abc} where
	a<sup>2</sup> = b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup> = e and
	(ab)<sup>2</sup> = (bc)<sup>2</sup> = (ac)<sup>2</sup> = e.
      </p>

      <p>
	Map (1,0,0) &#x2258; a, (0,1,0) &#x2258; b, and (0,0,1) &#x2258; c.
	Since each element of <span class="Set">Z<sub>2</sub></span> is a
	self-inverse this mapping satisfies all of the defining equations, and
	these two groups are isomorphic.
