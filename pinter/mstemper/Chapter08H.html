    Problem H &mdash; Generators of <span class="Set">A<sub>n</sub></span>
    and <span class="Set">S<sub>n</sub></span>
  </h1>

<div class="Section Problem" id="ProblemH">

  <p>
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
	Prove that the set <span class="Set">T</span> of all the transpositions
	in <span class="Set">S<sub>n</sub></span> generates
	<span class="Set">S<sub>n</sub></span>.
      </p>

      <p>
	As shown in Theorem 1, "[e]very permutation is either the identity, a
	single cycle, or a product of disjoint cycles." If we can show that
	the transpositions in <span class="Set">S<sub>n</sub></span> generate
	all of these, we are done.
      </p>

      <div class="SideBar">
      <p>
	Note that this is only true when n&ge;2. If n=1, then there are no
	transpositions in <span class="Set">S<sub>n</sub></span>, even though
	<span class="Set">S<sub>n</sub></span> contains one element (the
	identity) and is a group.
      </p>
      <p>
	The assumption that n&ge;2 will be used.
      </p>
      </div>

      <p>
	<span class="Case">Identity</span>
	Let (ab) be any transposition in <span class="Set">S<sub>n</sub></span>.
	The product (ab)(ab) is the identity. Therefore, the identity can be
	generated.
      </p>

      <p>
	<span class="Case">Single Cycle</span>
	It was shown in the text that "[...] every cycle can be expressed as
	a product of one or more transpositions." Therefore, any single cycle
	can be generated.
      </p>

      <p>
	<span class="Case">Product of Disjoint Cycles</span>
	Let &pi; be any permutation in <span class="Set">S<sub>n</sub></span>
	that is the product of disjoint cycles, say
	&pi; = &alpha;<sub>1</sub> ... &alpha;<sub>p</sub>. Since each
	&alpha;<sub>i</sub> can be expressed as a product of one or more
	transpositions, &pi; can be expressed as the product of all of those
	products.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li id="Ex02">
      <p>
	Prove that the set <span class="Set">T<sub>1</sub></span> = {(12),
	(13), ..., (1n)} generates <span class="Set">S<sub>n</sub></span>.
      </p>

      <p>
	Let (xy) be any transposition in <span class="Set">S<sub>n</sub></span>
	such that (xy)&notin; <span class="Set">T<sub>1</sub></span>.
	(That is, x&ne;1&ne;y.)
      </p>

      <p>
	(xy) = (1x)(1y)(1x). Since {(1x), (1y)} &sub;
	<span class="Set">T<sub>1</sub></span>, (xy) can be generated from
	<span class="Set">T<sub>1</sub></span>. Since the choice of x and y
	was arbitrary, this shows that any transposition not in
	<span class="Set">T<sub>1</sub></span> can be generated.
      </p>

      <p>
	Therefore, we have <em>all</em> of the transpositions, and
	<span class="Set">S<sub>n</sub></span> can be generated, as shown in
	Exercise 1.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
	Prove that every even permutation is a product of one or more cycles
	of length 3. Conclude the set <span class="Set">U</span> of all cycles
	of length 3 generates <span class="Set">A<sub>n</sub></span>.
      </p>

      <div class="SideBar">
      <p>
	Note that this is only true when n&ge;3. If n&lt;2, there are no
	cycles of length 3. The assumption that n&ge;3 will be used.
      </p>
      </div>

      <p>
	Let &pi; be any even permutation. Express it as the product of
	transpositions. Since &pi; is even, there is an even number of
	transpositions. Group them in pairs, starting from the left.
      </p>

      <p>
	For pair of transpositions, there are the following options: they are
	the same transposition, they are overlapping transpositions (having
	one element in common), or they are disjoint transpositions. Let's
	look at each case individually.
      </p>

      <p>
	<span class="Case">Same transposition</span>
	If an adjacent pair of transpositions has two instances of the same
	transposition, (xy)(xy), the product of this pair is the identity.
	(abc)(abc)(abc) = e, so (xy)(xy) may replaced (abc)(abc)(abc), which is
	the product of cycles of length three.
      </p>

      <p>
	<span class="Case">Overlapping transpositions</span>
	If an adjacent pair of transpositions has one element in common,
	(xz)(xy) = (zx)(xy) = (xz)(yx) = (zx)(yx) = (xyz), so this pair may be
	replaced by a cycle of length three.
      </p>

      <p>
	<span class="Case">Disjoint transpositions</span>
	If an adjacent pair of transpositions has no elements in common,
	(ab)(cd) = (cba)(acd), so this pair may be replaced by the product of
	cycles of length three.
      </p>

      <p>
	Since each pair of transpositions may be replaced by the product of
	one to three cycles of length three, &pi; may be expressed as the
	product of one or more cycles of length three. Since &pi; was any
	element of <span class="Set">A<sub>n</sub></span> may be expressed as
	the product of members of <span class="Set">U</span>, and
	<span class="Set">U</span> generates
	<span class="Set">A<sub>n</sub></span>.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
	Prove that the set <span class="Set">U<sub>1</sub></span> = {(123),
	(124), ..., (12n)} generates <span class="Set">A<sub>n</sub></span>.
      </p>

      <p>
	As shown in the hint, a three-cycle that does not contain 1 or 2 may be
	expressed as (abc) = (1ca)(1ba).
      </p>

      <p>
	As shown in the hint, a three-cycle that starts with 1 may be expressed
	as (1ab) = (1b2)(12a)(12b). If a three-cycle has 1 in another position,
	it may be expressed as (ab1) = (b1a) = (1ab), and still expressed as
	(1b2)(12a)(12b).
      </p>

      <p>
	This allows us to replace the (1ca) or the (1ba) in the first part
	with the product of a cycle starting with 1 and ending with 2 and two
	elements of <span class="Set">U<sub>1</sub></span>.
      </p>

      <p>
	A three-cycle that starts with 2 and does not contain 1 may be
	expressed as (2bc) = (1c2)(12b). Of course, (bc2) = (c2b) = (2bc).
	This again gives us the product of a cycle that starts with 1 and ends
	with 2 and an element of <span class="Set">U<sub>1</sub></span>.
      </p>

      <p>
	As shown in the hint, a three-cycle that starts with 1 and ends with 2
	may be expressed as (1b2) = (12b)<sup>2</sup>, which is the product
	of one (repeated) element of <span class="Set">U<sub>1</sub></span>.
      </p>

      <p>
	The identity may be expressed as e = (12a)<sup>3</sup>.
      </p>

      <p>
	So, any three-cycle and the identity may be expressed as the product
	of one or more members of <span class="Set">U<sub>1</sub></span>,
	which means that <span class="Set">U<sub>1</sub></span> generates
	<span class="Set">U</span>, which in turn generates
	<span class="Set">A<sub>n</sub></span>.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
	Prove that the pair of cycles (12) and (12...n) generates
	<span class="Set">S<sub>n</sub></span>.
      </p>

      <p>
	As stated in the hint, (12...n)(12)(12...n)<sup>-1</sup> = (23).
	Furthermore, (12...n)(i i+1)(12...n)<sup>-1</sup> = (i+1 i+2) when
	i+1&le;n and (i+1 1) when i+1=n. These are true because
	&pi;&alpha;&pi;<sup>-1</sup> is the cycle (&pi;(a<sub>1</sub>) ...
	&pi;(a<sub>s</sub>)), as shown in <a href="Chapter08E#Ex01">Exercise 1
	of Problem E</a> of this chapter.
      </p>

      <p>
	This shows that the cycles (12) and (12...n) generate {(12), (23),
	..., (n-1 n), (n1)}.
      </p>

      <p>
	As stated in the hint, (12)(23)(12) = (13). More generally,
	(1p)(pq)(1p) = (1q), as may be seen either from direct multiplication
	or from realizing that (1p) = (1p)<sup>-1</sup> and applying the
	result from <a href="Chapter08E#Ex01">Exercise 1 of Problem E</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
	Between these two results, the cycles (12) and (12...n) generate
	the set of transpositions <span class="Set">T<sub>1</sub></span> =
	{(12), (13), ..., (1n)}. As shown in <a href="#Ex02">Exercise 2</a>,
	<span class="Set">T<sub>1</sub></span> generates
	<span class="Set">S<sub>n</sub></span>.
      </p>
