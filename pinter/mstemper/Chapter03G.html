  <p>
    The <dfn>weight</dfn> of a binary word is the number of ones in it.
    The <dfn>distance</dfn> between <span title="of the same length">two
    binary words</span>, d(a,b), is the number of positions in which they
    differ.
    The <dfn>minimum distance</dfn> of a set of
    <span title="of the same length">binary words</span>
    is the smallest distance between any two distinct words in that set.

  <ol>
    <li id="Ex01">
      <p>Verify that each codeword in the following set,

    <li>
      <p>Define a code, C<sub>2</sub> in
	 <span class="Set">B<sup>6</sup></span>, with the first three bits
	 being information, and the remainder satisying:
	 a<sub>4</sub>=a<sub>2</sub>,
	 a<sub>5</sub>=a<sub>1</sub>+a<sub>2</sub>, and
	 a<sub>6</sub>=a<sub>1</sub>+a<sub>2</sub>+a<sub>3</sub>.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
	  <p>List the codewords in C<sub>2</sub>:</p>
	  <p>000000, 001001, 010111, 011110, 100011, 101010, 110100, 111101</p>
	</li>
        <li>
	  <p>Find the minimum distance between codewords in C<sub>2</sub>.</p>
	  <p>The distance between 000000 and 001001 (and some other pairs)
	     is two. Since the information part of every codeword differs
	     from that of every other codeword, and the parity part of each
	     codeword also differs from that of every other codeword, no
	     smaller difference is possible.</p>
	</li>
        <li>
	  <p>How many errors in any word of C<sub>2</sub> are guaranteed to
	     to be detected?</p>
	  <p>This code is only guaranteed to detect single errors, since there
	     are pairs of codewords that only differ in two positions.</p>
	</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Design a code in <span class="Set">B<sup>4</sup></span>, with two
	 positions for information and two for parity.</p>
      <p>Let a<sub>3</sub>=a<sub>1</sub> and a<sub>4</sub>=a<sub>2</sub>.
	 The codewords are then 0000, 0101, 1010, and 1111. The minimum
	 distance is 2.</p> 
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Find the words in C<sub>1</sub> closest to each of the following:</p>
      <table>
        <tr><td>11111</td><td>11101</td></tr>
        <tr><td>00101</td><td>00111</td></tr>
        <tr><td>11000</td><td>11010</td></tr>
        <tr><td>10011</td><td>11101</td></tr>
        <tr><td>10001</td><td>10011</td></tr>
        <tr><td>10111</td><td>00111, 10011</td></tr>
      </table> 
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>For a code in <span class="Set">B<sup>n</sup></span> with a
	 minimum distance of m, prove that it is always possible to
	 detect up to m-1 transmission errors in a single word.</p>
      <p>Since any two words, a and b, will always differ in m bits, an
	 error involving no more than m-1 bits will change the transmitted
	 word into something that differs from any word by at least one
	 bit.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
	Define the <dfn>sphere of radius k</dfn> about the word a to be the
	set of all words in <span class="Set">B<sup>n</sup></span> such that
	their distance from a is no greater than k. S(a;k) =
	{x&isin;<span class="Set">B<sup>n</sup></span> : d(a,x)&le;k}.
	If m is the minimum distance for some set of binary words, and
	t=(m-1)/2, show that any two spheres of radius t have an empty
	intersection.
      </p>

      <p>
	First, I will show that d, as previously defined, is a <span title="I don't know if this is useful, I just like metric functions">
	metric function</span>.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>d(a,a) = 0 &mdash; This is true, since a binary word doesn't
	    differ in any positions from itself.</li>
	<li>d(a,b) &gt; 0 when a&ne;b &mdash; Since a and b must differ in
	    at least one position to be different words, this is also
	    true.</li>
	<li>d(a,b) = d(b,a) &mdash; The number of bits that differ between
	    a and b is the same no matter which we look at first.</li>
	<li>d(a,b)+d(b,c) &ge; d(a,c) &mdash; If none of the positions
	    in which a and b differ are the same as any of the positions
	    in which c and b differ, then d(a,b)+d(b,c) = d(a,c).
	    Otherwise, we have the case where a and c both differ from
	    b in the same position at least once. In any of these
	    positions, a and c then have the same bits, so their distance
	    is reduced by the number of positions of overlap.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
	Therefore, d is a metric function.
      </p>

      <p>
	Let a and c be words in <span class="Set">B<sup>n</sup></span>,
	with a&ne;c.
	Assume that the two spheres, S(a;t) and S(c;t), have an non-empty
	intersection. Let b &isin; S(a;t)&cap;S(c;t). Then, since
	b&isin;S(a;t), d(a,b)&le;t. Similarly, d(b,c)&le;t. By the triangle
	inequality, d(a,c)&le;t+t. t+t = 2t = 2(m-1)/2 = m-1. Since the
	minimum distance between two distinct words is m, the assumption
	that S(a;t) and S(c;t), have an non-empty intersection is false.
      </p>

      <p>
	Another way to show this is to notice that, since (m-1)/2 is less
	than m, any sphere, S(x;t), contains only one element, x.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
	Use the fact just shown to prove that in any transmission of a codeword
	that has no more than t transmission errors, the codeword can be
	correctly decoded.
      </p>

      <p>
	This follows immediately from the fact that
	any sphere, S(x;t), contains only one element, x.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
	Show that any transmission of a codeword in C<sub>2</sub> with one
	error can be corrected and any transmissions of two errors can be
	detected.
      </p>

      <p>
	Since the minimum distance of C<sub>2</sub> is 2, t = (m-1)/2 = 1/2.
	Therefore, the claim is false. A received code word of 000001 can be
	detected as incorrect, but it is not possible to tell whether it
	was supposed to be 000000 or 001001, either of which differs from it
	in only one position.
      </p>
    </li>
         
  </ol>
