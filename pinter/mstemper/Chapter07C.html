  <h1 id="Top">Problem C &mdash; Groups of Permutations of
  <span class="Set">R</span></h1>

<div class="Section Problem" id="ProblemC">

  <p>
    <span class="Set">A</span> is a subset of <span class="Set">R</span>, and
    <span class="Set">G</span> is a set of permutations of
    <span class="Set">A</span>. Show that <span class="Set">G</span> is a
    subgroup of <span class="Set">S<sub>A</sub></span> and give its table.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
	<span class="Set">A</span> = <span class="Set">R</span>-{0,1}.
	<span class="Set">G</span> = {e,f,g}, where f(x)=1/(1-x) and
	g(x)=(x-1)/x.
      </p>

      <p>
	f(a) = 1/(1-a) and f(b) = 1/(1-b), when a&ne;1&ne;b. Setting
	f(a)=f(b) gives 1/(1-a) = 1/(1-b). Given the restriction on the
	domain of f, we can multiply both sides by (1-a)(1-b), yielding
	1-b = 1-a, or a = b. Therefore, f is one-to-one.
	Since 0 has no reciprocal, it is not in the range of f.
	Let y = 1/(1-x). Then, y=1 when x=0. Since 0 is excluded from the
	range of f, 1 is not in the range of f.
	For any p&isin;<span class="Set">R</span>-{0,1}, we have p = 1/(1-x).
	Solving for x gives x = (p-1)/p, with p&notin;{0,1}.
	Therefore, f is onto <span class="Set">R</span>-{0,1}, and an element
	of <span class="Set">S<sub>A</sub></span>.
      </p>

      <p>
	g(a) = (a-1)/a and g(b) = (b-1)/b, when a&ne;0&ne;b. Setting
	g(a)=g(b) gives (a-1)/a = (b-1)/b. Given the restriction on the
	domain of g, we can multiply both sides by ab, yielding ab-b = ab-a,
	or a = b. Therefore, g is one-to-one.
	Let y = (x-1)/x. Then y=0 when x=1. Since 1 is excluded from the range
	of g and g is one-to-one, 0 is not in the range of g.
	Setting y = 1 = (x-1)/x gives x-1 = x, so 1 is not in the range of g.
	For any q&isin;<span class="Set">R</span>-{0,1}, we have q = (x-1)/x.
	Solving for x gives x = 1/(1-q), with q&notin;{0,1}.
	Therefore, g is onto <span class="Set">R</span>-{0,1}, and an element
	of <span class="Set">S<sub>A</sub></span>.
      </p>

      <p>
	Since the identity function, e, on any set is a permutation on that
	set, we have {e,f,g}&sub;<span class="Set">S<sub>A</sub></span>.
      </p>

      <p>
	[g&#8728;f](x) = ((1/(1-x)-1)/(1/(1-x)) =
	(1-x)(1/(1-x)-1) = 1-(1-x) = x, so g = f<sup>-1</sup>.
	[f&#8728;g](x) = 1/(1-(x-1)/x) = x/(x-x-1) = x, so f = g<sup>-1</sup>.
	Therefore, <span class="Set">G</span> is closed under inversion.
      </p>

      <p>
	[f&#8728;f](x) = 1/(1-1/(1-x)) = (1-x)/((1-x)-1) = (1-x)/(-x) =
	(x-1)/x = g(x).
	[g&#8728;g](x) = (((x-1)/x)-1)/((x-1)/x) = (x-1-x)/(x-1) =
	-1/(x-1) = 1/(x-1) = f(x).
	With this and the previous result we have shown that,
	<span class="Set">G</span> is closed under multiplication.
      </p>

      <p>
	Therefore, <span class="Set">G</span> is a subgroup of
	<span class="Set">S<sub>A</sub></span>. Its table follows:
      </p>

      <table class="Cayley">
	<tr>
	  <th>&#8728;</th>
	  <th>e</th>
	  <th>f</th>
	  <th>g</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <th>e</th>
	  <td>e</td>
	  <td>f</td>
	  <td>g</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <th>f</th>
	  <td>f</td>
	  <td>g</td>
	  <td>e</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <th>g</th>
	  <td>g</td>
	  <td>e</td>
	  <td>f</td>
	</tr>
      </table>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
	<span class="Set">A</span> = <span class="Set">R</span>-{0}.
	<span class="Set">G</span> = {e,f,g,h}, where f(x)=1/x, g(x)=-x, and
	h(x)=-1/x.
      </p>

      <p>
	f(a) = 1/a and f(b) = 1/b, when ab&ne;0. Setting f(a)=f(b) gives
	1/a = 1/b, or a=b. Therefore, f is one-to-one.
	Since any non-zero real has a reciprocal, f is onto
	<span class="Set">R</span>-{0}.
	Therefore, f is a permutation on <span class="Set">R</span>-{0}, and
	an element of <span class="Set">S<sub>A</sub></span>.
      </p>

      <p>
	g(x) is obviously one-to-one and onto <span class="Set">R</span>-{0},
	so it is also a permutation and an element of
	<span class="Set">S<sub>A</sub></span>.
      </p>

      <p>
	The demonstration that h is an element of
	<span class="Set">S<sub>A</sub></span> is nearly identical to that
	for f.
	We therefore have {e,f,g,h}&sub;<span class="Set">S<sub>A</sub></span>.
      </p>

      <p>
	[f&#8728;f](x) = x = e(x), so f is its own inverse.
      </p>

      <p>
	[g&#8728;g](x) = x = e(x), so g is its own inverse.
      </p>

      <p>
	[h&#8728;h](x) = x = e(x), so h is its own inverse.
      </p>

      <p>
	Therefore, {e,f,g,h} is closed under inversion.
      </p>

      <p>
	[f&#8728;g](x) = 1/-x = h(x).
	[f&#8728;h](x) = -x = g(x).
      </p>

      <p>
	[g&#8728;f](x) = 1/-x = h(x).
	[g&#8728;h](x) = 1/x = f(x).
      </p>

      <p>
	[h&#8728;f](x) = -x = g(x).
	[h&#8728;g](x) = 1/x = f(x).
      </p>

      <p>
	This shows that <span class="Set">G</span> is closed under
	multiplication.
	Therefore, <span class="Set">G</span> is a subgroup of
	<span class="Set">S<sub>A</sub></span>. Its table follows:
      </p>

      <table class="Cayley">
	<tr>
	  <th>&#8728;</th>
	  <th>e</th>
	  <th>f</th>
	  <th>g</th>
	  <th>h</th>

	  <td>h</td>
	  <td>e</td>
	  <td>f</td>

	<tr>
	  <th>h</th>
	  <td>h</td>
	  <td>g</td>

	</tr>
      </table>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
	<span class="Set">A</span> = <span class="Set">R</span>-{0,1}.
	<span class="Set">G</span> = {e,f,g,h,j,k}, where f(x)=1-x,
	g(x)=1/x, h(x)=1/(1-x), j(x)=(x-1)/x, k(x)=x/(x-1).
      </p>

      <p>
	f(a) = 1-a and f(b) = 1-b. Setting f(a)=f(b) give a = b, so f is
	one-to-one.
	Since 1-x = 0 when x=1 and 1-x = 1 when x=0, neither 0 nor 1 is in
	the range of f.
	For any p&isin;<span class="Set">R</span>-{0,1}, f(1-p) = p, so
	f is onto <span class="Set">R</span>-{0,1}.
	Therefore, f is a permutation on <span class="Set">R</span>-{0,1}
	and an element of <span class="Set">S<sub>A</sub></span>.
      </p>

      <p>
	g(a) = 1/a and g(b) = 1/b, so g(a) = g(b) only when a=b, and g is
	one-to-one.
	Since 1/x&ne;0 and 1/x=1 when x is outside the domain of g, neither
	0 nor 1 is in the range of g.
	For any q&isin;<span class="Set">R</span>-{0,1}, g(1/q) = q, so g
	is onto <span class="Set">R</span>-{0,1}.
	Therefore, g is a permutation on <span class="Set">R</span>-{0,1}
	and an element of <span class="Set">S<sub>A</sub></span>.
      </p>

      <p>
	The proofs that h and j are elements of
	<span class="Set">S<sub>A</sub></span> was given in Exercise 1 of
	this problem.
      </p>

      <p>
	With a,b&notin;{0,1}, k(a) = a/(a-1) and k(b) = b/(b-1). Setting
	k(a)=k(b) gives a/(a-1) = b/(b-1). With the given restriction on
	the domain of k, this yields a = b, so k is one-to-one.
	0/(0-1) = 0. Since 0 is not in the domain of k, it is not in its
	range, either. Since x&ne;x-1, 1 is not in the range of k.
	For any r&notin;{0,1}, let f(x)=r. Solving for x gives x = r/(r-1),
	so k is onto <span class="Set">R</span>-{0,1} and an element of
	<span class="Set">S<sub>A</sub></span>.
      </p>

      <p>
	Therefore, {e,f,g,h,j,k}&sub;<span class="Set">S<sub>A</sub></span>.
      </p>

      <p>
      	[f&#8728;f](x) = 1-(1-x) = x = e(x), so f is its own inverse.
      </p>

      <p>
      	[g&#8728;g](x) = 1/(1/x) = x = e(x), so g is its own inverse.
      </p>

      <p>
      	[h&#8728;j](x) = 1/(1-(x-1)/x) = x = e(x), so h = j<sup>-1</sup>.
      </p>

      <p>
      	[j&#8728;h](x) = (1/(1-x)-1)/(1/(1-x)) = x = e(x), so
	j = h<sup>-1</sup>.
      </p>

      <p>
      	[k&#8728;k](x) = ((x/(x-1))/((x/(x-1))-1) = x = e(x), so
	k is its own inverse.
      </p>

      <p>
	Therefore, {e,f,g,h,j,k} is closed under inversion.
      </p>

      <p>
	The following table shows that {e,f,g,h,j,k} is closed under
	multiplication and hence a subgroup of
	<span class="Set">S<sub>A</sub></span>:
      </p>

    <li>
      <p>
	<span class="Set">A</span> = <span class="Set">R</span>-{0,1,2}.
	<span class="Set">G</span> is the subgroup of
	<span class="Set">S<sub>A</sub></span> generated by
	f(x)=2-x and g(x)=2/x.
      </p>

      <p>
	It is obvious that f and g are one-to-one.
      </p>

      <p>
	Since 2-0 = 2, 2-1 = 1, and 2-2 = 0, the exclusion of these from
	the domain of f also excludes them from its range.
	For any a&isin;<span class="Set">R</span>-{0,1,2}, f(2-a) = a, so
	f is onto <span class="Set">R</span>-{0,1,2}, and hence an
	element of <span class="Set">S<sub>A</sub></span>.
      </p>

      <p>
	Since 2/1 = 2, 2/2 = 1, and 0 has no reciprocal, the exclusion of
	{0,1,2} from the domain of g also excludes them from its range.
	For any b&isin;<span class="Set">R</span>-{0,1,2}, g(2a) = a, so
	g is onto <span class="Set">R</span>-{0,1,2}, and hence an
	element of <span class="Set">S<sub>A</sub></span>.
      </p>

      <p>
	Since the composition of permutations is a permutation, all possible
	combinations of f and g will be elements of
	<span class="Set">S<sub>A</sub></span>.
      </p>

      <p>
	f and g are their own inverses.
      </p>

      <p>
	Let h(x) = [f&#8728;g](x) = 2-(2/x).
      </p>

      <p>
	Let j(x) = [g&#8728;f](x) = 2/(2-x).
	(Note that since f&#8728;g &ne; g&#8728;f, this subgroup will not be
	commutative.)
      </p>

      <p>
	Let k(x) = [f&#8728;j](x) = (2-2x)/(2-x).
      </p>

      <p>
	Let l(x) = [g&#8728;j](x) = x/(x-1).
      </p>

      <p>
	Finally, let m(x) = [f&#8728;l](x) = (x-2)/(x-1).
