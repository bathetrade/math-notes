  <h1 id="Top">Problem G &mdash; Even/Odd Permutations in Subgroups
    of <span class="Set">S<sub>n</sub></span></h1>

<div class="Section Problem" id="ProblemG">

  <p>
    Prove or disprove each of the following in
    <span class="Set">S<sub>n</sub></span>:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li id="Ex01">
      <p>
	Let &alpha;<sub>1</sub>, ..., &alpha;<sub>r</sub> be distinct even
	permutations, and &beta; an odd permutation. Then
	&alpha;<sub>1</sub>&beta;, ... &alpha;<sub>r</sub>&beta; are
	<em>distinct</em> odd permutations.
      </p>

      <p>
	As shown in <a href="Chapter08C#Ex02c">Problem C, Exercise 2c</a>, the
	product of an even permutation and an odd permutation is odd.
	Therefore, &alpha;<sub>1</sub>&beta;, ... &alpha;<sub>r</sub>&beta;
	are odd permutations.
      </p>

      <p>
	To show that &alpha;<sub>1</sub>&beta;, ... &alpha;<sub>r</sub>&beta;
	are distinct, contradiction will be used.
      </p>

      <p>
	Assume that for some i&ne;j (1&le;i&le;r and 1&le;j&le;r),
	&alpha;<sub>i</sub>&beta; = &alpha;<sub>j</sub>&beta;. Then,
	&alpha;<sub>i</sub>&beta;&beta;<sup>-1</sup> =
	&alpha;<sub>j</sub>&beta;&beta;<sup>-1</sup>, which gives
	&alpha;<sub>i</sub>e = &alpha;<sub>j</sub>e, or
	&alpha;<sub>i</sub> = &alpha;<sub>j</sub>, which contradicts the fact
	that the &alpha;s are distinct.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li id="Ex02">
      <p>
	If &beta;<sub>1</sub>, ..., &beta;<sub>r</sub> are distinct odd
	permutations,
	&beta;<sub>1</sub>&beta;<sub>1</sub>, 
	&beta;<sub>1</sub>&beta;<sub>2</sub>, ...
	&beta;<sub>1</sub>&beta;<sub>r</sub> are
	<em>distinct</em> even permutations.
      </p>

      <p>
	As shown in <a href="Chapter08C#Ex02b">Problem C, Exercise 2b</a>, the
	product of two odd permutations is even.
	Therefore, &beta;<sub>1</sub>&beta;<sub>1</sub>, 
	&beta;<sub>1</sub>&beta;<sub>2</sub>, ...
	&beta;<sub>1</sub>&beta;<sub>r</sub> are even permutations.
      </p>

      <p>
	To show that &beta;<sub>1</sub>&beta;<sub>1</sub>, 
	&beta;<sub>1</sub>&beta;<sub>2</sub>, ...
	&beta;<sub>1</sub>&beta;<sub>r</sub> are distinct, contradiction will
	again be used.
      </p>

      <p>
	Assume that for some i&ne;j (1&le;i&le;r and 1&le;j&le;r),
	&beta;<sub>1</sub>&beta;<sub>i</sub> =
	&beta;<sub>1</sub>&beta;<sub>j</sub>. Then,
	&beta;<sub>1</sub><sup>-1</sup>&beta;<sub>1</sub>&beta;<sub>i</sub> =
	&beta;<sub>1</sub><sup>-1</sup>&beta;<sub>1</sub>&beta;<sub>j</sub>.
	Then, e&beta;<sub>i</sub> = e&beta;<sub>j</sub> and
	&beta;<sub>i</sub> = &beta;<sub>j</sub>, which contradicts the fact
	that the &beta;s are distinct.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <div class="SideBar">
      <p>
	This is not true in the case where n=1.
	<span class="Set">S<sub>1</sub></span> consists of only the identity
	function, which is even. <span class="Set">S<sub>1</sub></span> has no
	odd permutations.
      </p>
      </div>

      <p>
	In <span class="Set">S<sub>n</sub></span>, there are the same number
	of odd permutations as even permutations.
      </p>

      <p>
	Assume n&ge;2. Label two of the elements of the underlying set
	"&mu;" and "&eta;". Then <span class="Set">S<sub>n</sub></span>
	contains the transposition (&mu;&eta;), which is odd. Therefore, if
	n&ge;2, <span class="Set">S<sub>n</sub></span> contains at least
	one odd permutation.
      </p>

      <p>
	With n&ge;2, let "r" be the number of distinct even permutations in
	<span class="Set">S<sub>n</sub></span>. Since
	<span class="Set">S<sub>n</sub></span> contains an odd permutation,
	we can take the product of each of the r distinct even permutations
	with this odd permutation. Each of these products is a distinct odd
	permutation, which means that <span class="Set">S<sub>n</sub></span>
	must contain <em>at least</em> r odd permutations.
      </p>

      <p>
	With n&ge;2, let "s" be the number of distinct odd permutations in
	<span class="Set">S<sub>n</sub></span>. (Note that s&ge;1.) Select
	any one of them and form its product with each of the odd permutations
	(including itself). This will yield s distinct even permutations, which
	means that the number of distinct even permutations in
	<span class="Set">S<sub>n</sub></span> is at least s.
      </p>

      <p>
	Since the number of odd permutations in
	<span class="Set">S<sub>n</sub></span> must be at least as large as the
	number of even permutations and the number of even permutations must
	be at least as large as the number of odd permutations,
	<span class="Set">S<sub>n</sub></span> must have as many odd
	permutations as even permutations.
      </p>

      <p>
	When n&ge;2.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>

      <div class="SideBar">
      <p>
	This is denoted by <span class="Set">A<sub>n</sub></span>, and called
	the <dfn>alternating group</dfn> on n symbols.
      </p>
      </div>

      <p>
	The set of all even permutations is a subgroup of
	<span class="Set">S<sub>n</sub></span>.
      </p>

      <p>
	Let &alpha; and &beta; be two even permutations in
	<span class="Set">S<sub>n</sub></span> (not necessarily unique). As
	shown in <a href="Chapter08C#Ex02a">Problem C, Exercise 2a</a>,
	the product of two even permutations is even. Therefore, the set of all
	even permutations in <span class="Set">S<sub>n</sub></span> is closed
	under multiplication.
      </p>

      <p>
	It was shown in the text that the identity permutation is even. Since
	the product of an even permutation and an odd permutation is odd, and
	the product of a permutation and its inverse is even, the inverse of an
	even permutation must also be even. Therefore, the set of all even
	permutations in <span class="Set">S<sub>n</sub></span> is closed
	under inversion.
      </p>

      <p>
	Since the set of all even permutations in
	<span class="Set">S<sub>n</sub></span> is closed under multiplication
	and inversion, it is a subgroup of
	<span class="Set">S<sub>n</sub></span>.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
	Let <span class="Set">H</span> be any subgroup of
	<span class="Set">S<sub>n</sub></span>. <span class="Set">H</span>
	either contains only even permutations or it contains equal numbers of
	even and odd permutations.
      </p>

      <p>
	Since <span class="Set">H</span> is a group, it is closed under
	multiplication. As shown in <a href="#Ex02">Exercise 2</a>, it must
	have at least as many even permutations as odd ones.
      </p>

      <p>
	Let <span class="Set">H</span> contain at least one odd permutation.
	Since it is a group, it contains the identity, which is even. Since
	it is a group and therefore closed under multiplication, it must have
	at least as many odd permutations as even ones, as shown in
	<a href="#Ex01">Exercise 1</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
	It is therefore possible for <span class="Set">H</span> to either
	contain only even permutations or for it to contain equal numbers of
	even and odd permutations.
