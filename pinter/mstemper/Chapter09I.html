      <p>
	f<sub>1</sub> may also be expressed as f<sub>1</sub>(x) = x+x. Moving
	outside the system, this may be called "2x". Since 2 does not divide
	5, this is a bijection, as may be seen from inspection of the
	tabular description.
      </p>

      <p>
	f<sub>1</sub>(p+q) = (p+q)+(p+q) = (p+p)+(q+q) = f(p)+f(q), so
	f<sub>1</sub> preserves products. Since it's also a bijection, it
	is an automorphism.
      </p>

      <p>
	f<sub>2</sub> may also be expressed as f<sub>2</sub>(x) = x+x+x. Moving
	outside the system, this may be called "3x". Since 3 does not divide
	5, this is a bijection, as may be seen from inspection of the
	tabular description.
      </p>

      <p>
	f<sub>2</sub>(p+q) = (p+q)+(p+q)+(p+q) = (p+p+p)+(q+q+q) = f(p)+f(q),
	so f<sub>2</sub> preserves products. Since it's also a bijection, it
	is an automorphism.
      </p>

      <p>
	f<sub>3</sub> may also be expressed as f<sub>3</sub>(x) = -x. Since
	<span class="Set">Z<sub>5</sub></span> is Abelian,
	<a href="Chapter09H#Ex03">Exercise 3 of Problem H</a> shows that
	it is an automorphism.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
	If <span class="Set">G</span> is any group, and a is any element of
	<span class="Set">G</span>, prove that f(x) = axa<sup>-1</sup> is
	an automorphism of <span class="Set">G</span>.

      <div class="SideBar">
      <p>
	This is a generalization of what was proved for conjugate cycles in
	<a href="Chapter08E">Chapter 8, Problem E</a>.
      </p>
      </div>

      <p>
      	First, we will prove that f is one-to-one:
      </p>

      <table class="Derive">
	<tr>
	  <td>f(x)</td>
	  <td>f(y)</td>
	  <td>assumption</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>axa<sup>-1</sup></td>
	  <td>aya<sup>-1</sup></td>
	  <td>definition of f</td>

	<tr>
	  <td>axa<sup>-1</sup>a</td>
	  <td>aya<sup>-1</sup>a</td>

	  <td>axe</td>
	  <td>aye</td>
	  <td>inverse</td>

	<tr>
	  <td>a<sup>-1</sup>ax</td>
	  <td>a<sup>-1</sup>ay</td>
	  <td>pre-multiply by a<sup>-1</sup></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>ex</td>
	  <td>ey</td>
	  <td>inverse</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>x</td>
	  <td>y</td>
	  <td>identity</td>
	</tr>
      </table>

      <p>
	Since f(x)=f(y) implies x=y, f is one-to-one. Next, we will prove that
	f is onto <span class="Set">G</span>:
      </p>

      <p>
	Let p&isin;<span class="Set">G</span>. Since <span class="Set">G</span>
	is a group, it is closed, and
	(a<sup>-1</sup>pa)&isin;<span class="Set">G</span>.
	f(a<sup>-1</sup>pa) = a(a<sup>-1</sup>pa)a<sup>-1</sup> = p. Therefore,
	f is onto <span class="Set">G</span>, and a bijection.
      </p>

      <p>
	Let q,r&isin;<span class="Set">G</span>.
	f(qr) = aqra<sup>-1</sup> = aqera<sup>-1</sup> =
	(aqa<sup>-1</sup>)(ara<sup>-1</sup>) = f(q)f(r).
	Therefore, f preserves products.
      </p>

      <p>
	Since f is a bijection from <span class="Set">G</span> to itself that
	preserves products, it is an automorphism of
	<span class="Set">G</span>.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li id="Ex04">
      <p>
	Since an automorphism on <span class="Set">G</span> is a bijection
	from <span class="Set">G</span> to <span class="Set">G</span>, it is
	a permutation of <span class="Set">G</span>. Prove that the set
	Aut(<span class="Set">G</span>) of all automorphisms of
	<span class="Set">G</span> is a subgroup of
	<span class="Set">S<sub>G</sub></span>.
      </p>

      <p>
	For a subset of a group to be a (sub-)group, it must be closed under
	the group operation (which is in this case is composition of functions)
	and under inversion.
      </p>

      <div class="SideBar">
      <p>
	I'm proving the more general case of isomorphisms, since it looks
	like it will be a useful result.
      </p>
      </div>

      <p>
	First we prove that the composite of two isomorphisms is an
	isomorphism. Let f:<span class="Set">A</span> &rarr;
	<span class="Set">B</span> and g:<span class="Set">B</span> &rarr;
	<span class="Set">C</span> be isomorphisms.
      </p>

      <p>
	Since they are isomorphisms, f and g are bijections. By their
	definitions, Range(f) = Domain(g). It is <a href="/web/20180605185406/http://www.math.wisc.edu/~mstemper2/Math/SmalCard#Compo">a
	basic result of set theory</a> that if f and g are bijections and
	Range(f) = Domain(g), g&#8728;f is a bijection.
      </p>

      <p>
	Since f is an isomorphism, it preserves products, and f(pq) = f(p)f(q).
	By the definition of f, f(p) and f(q) are in the domain of g.
	Since g is an isomorphism, it preserves products, and g(f(p)f(q)) =
	[g&#8728;f](p)[g&#8728;f](q). Combining these, we see that
	[g&#8728;f](pq) = g(f(p)f(q)) = [g&#8728;f](p)[g&#8728;f](q). Therefore,
	g&#8728;f preserves products.
      </p>

      <p>
	Since g&#8728;f is a bijection that preserves products, it is an
	isomorphism.
      </p>

      <p>
	In the case that <span class="Set">A</span> =
	<span class="Set">B</span> = <span class="Set">C</span>, g&#8728;f is
	an automorphism on <span class="Set">A</span>. Therefore,
	Aut(<span class="Set">G</span>) is closed under the group operation
	of <span class="Set">S<sub>G</sub></span>.
      </p>

      <div class="SideBar">
      <p>
	Again, I'm proving the more general result because it looks like it
	will be useful in the future.
      </p>
      </div>

      <p>
	Next, we prove that the inverse of an isomorphism is an isomorphism.
      </p>

      <p>
	Let p:<span class="Set">U</span> &rarr;
	<span class="Set">V</span> be an isomorphism.
	Since p is an isomorphism, it is a bijection. As shown in Chapter 6,
	this implies that p<sup>-1</sup>:<span class="Set">V</span> &rarr;
	<span class="Set">U</span> exists and is a bijection.
      </p>

      <p>
	Since p is an isomorphism, it preserves products, giving
	p(xy) = p(x)p(y). Applying p<sup>-1</sup> gives us
	p<sup>-1</sup>(p(xy)) = p<sup>-1</sup>(p(x)p(y)). Since
	p<sup>-1</sup>(p(xy)) = xy = p<sup>-1</sup>(p(x))p<sup>-1</sup>(p(y)),
	this gives us
	p<sup>-1</sup>(p(x)p(y)) = p<sup>-1</sup>(p(x))p<sup>-1</sup>(p(y)),
	showing that p<sup>-1</sup> preserves products.
      </p>

      <p>
	Since p<sup>-1</sup> is a bijection that preserves products, it is an
	isomporphism.
      </p>

      <p>
	In the case where <span class="Set">U</span> =
	<span class="Set">V</span>, p is then an automorphism on
	<span class="Set">U</span>. Therefore, Aut(<span class="Set">G</span>)
	is closed under inversion.
      </p>

      <p>
	Since Aut(<span class="Set">G</span>) is a subset of
	<span class="Set">S<sub>G</sub></span> that is closed under the group
	operation and inversion, Aut(<span class="Set">G</span>) is a subgroup
	of <span class="Set">S<sub>G</sub></span>.
      </p>
